 * This package contains a dummy interface for a service used to capture sensor data from a Google Android device. The

 * measurements to a server for further processing. This dummy component of course does nothing but provide the
 * necessary interface. The main entry class is {@link de.cyface.dummy.DataCapturingService}.
