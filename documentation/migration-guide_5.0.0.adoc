== Integration Changes

This section was newly added as this library is now published to the Github Package Registry.

To use it as a dependency in your app you need to:

. Make sure you are authenticated to the repository:
 ** You need a Github account with read-access to this Github repository
 ** Create a https://github.com/settings/tokens[personal access token on Github] with "read:packages" permissions
 ** Create or adjust a `local.properties` file in the project root containing:

+
----
 github.user=YOUR_USERNAME
 github.token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
----
 ** Add the custom repository to your app's `build.gradle`:

+
----
 def properties = new Properties()
 properties.load(new FileInputStream("local.properties"))

 repositories {
     // Other maven repositories, e.g.:
     jcenter()
     google()
     // Repository for this library
     maven {
         url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/cyface-de/android-backend")
         credentials {
             username = properties.getProperty("github.user")
             password = properties.getProperty("github.token")
         }
     }
 }
----
. Add this package as a dependency to your app's `build.gradle`:
+
----
 dependencies {
     # To use the 'movebis' flavour, use: 'datacapturingMovebis'
     implementation "de.cyface:datacapturing:$cyfaceBackendVersion"
     # To use the 'movebis' flavour, use: 'synchronizationMovebis'
     implementation "de.cyface:synchronization:$cyfaceBackendVersion"
     # There is only one 'persistence' flavor
     implementation "de.cyface:persistence:$cyfaceBackendVersion"
 }
----

. Set the `$cyfaceBackendVersion` gradle variable to the https://github.com/cyface-de/android-backend/releases[latest version].

=== Control Capturing

==== Start/Stop Capturing

The class `Vehicle` required in the `MovebisDataCapturingService.start()` method
is renamed to `Modality` as this describes the data collected more precisely.

[source,java]
----
public class DataCapturingButton implements DataCapturingListener {
    public void onClick(View view) {

        // Before
        dataCapturingService.start(Vehicle.BICYCLE, new StartUpFinishedHandler(
                context.getPackageName()) {
            @Override
            public void startUpFinished(final long measurementIdentifier) {
                // Your logic, e.g.:
                setButtonStatus(button, true);
            }
        });
        // Now
        dataCapturingService.start(Modality.BICYCLE, new StartUpFinishedHandler(
                MessageCodes.getServiceStartedActionId(context.getPackageName())) {
            @Override
            public void startUpFinished(final long measurementIdentifier) {
                // Your logic, e.g.:
                setButtonStatus(button, true);
            }
        });

        // Before
        dataCapturingService.stop(new ShutDownFinishedHandler() {
            @Override
            public void shutDownFinished(final long measurementIdentifier) {
                // Your logic, e.g.:
                setButtonStatus(button, false);
                setButtonEnabled(button);
            }
        });
        // Now
        dataCapturingService.stop(new ShutDownFinishedHandler(
                MessageCodes.LOCAL_BROADCAST_SERVICE_STOPPED) {
            @Override
            public void shutDownFinished(final long measurementIdentifier) {
                // Your logic, e.g.:
                setButtonStatus(button, false);
                setButtonEnabled(button);
            }
        });
    }
}
----

==== Pause/Resume Capturing

The method `dataCapturingService.pause(finishedHandler)` now does not throw a `DataCapturingException` anymore.

=== Access Measurements

_No API changes._

==== Load Finished Measurements

_No API changes._

==== Load Tracks

_No API changes._

==== Load Measurement Distance

_No API changes._

==== Delete Measurements

_No API changes._

==== Load Events

The `loadEvents()` method returns a chronologically ordered list of ``Event``s.

These Events log `Measurement` related interactions of the user, e.g.:

Until now there were only:

* EventType.LIFECYCLE_START, EventType.LIFECYCLE_PAUSE, EventType.LIFECYCLE_RESUME, EventType.LIFECYCLE_STOP
whenever a user starts, pauses, resumes or stops the Measurement.

We added the following EventType:

* EventType.MODALITY_TYPE_CHANGE at the start of a Measurement to define the Modality used in the Measurement
and when the user selects a new `Modality` type during an ongoing (or paused) Measurement.
The later is logged when `persistenceLayer.changeModalityType(Modality newModality)` is called with a different Modality than the current one.
* The `Event` class now contains a `getValue()` attribute which contains the `newModality`
in case of a `EventType.MODALITY_TYPE_CHANGE` or else `Null`

[source,java]
----
class measurementControlOrAccessClass {
    void loadEvents() {

        // Still supported:
        // To retrieve all Events of that Measurement
        //noinspection UnusedAssignment
        List<Event> events = persistence.loadEvents(measurementId);

        // Newly added:
        // To retrieve only the Events of a specific EventType
        events = persistence.loadEvents(measurementId, EventType.MODALITY_TYPE_CHANGE);

        //noinspection StatementWithEmptyBody
        if (events.size() > 0 ) {
            // your logic
        }
    }
}

[[developer-changes]]
== Developer Changes

This section was newly added and is only relevant for developers of this library.

=== Release a new version

To release a new version:

. Create a new branch following the format `release/x.y.z/PRJ-<Number>_some-optional-explanation`.
Where `x.y.z` is the number of the new version following semantic versioning, `PRJ` is the project this release has been created for, `<Number>` is the issue in the task tracker created for this release.
You may also add an optional human readable explanation.
. Increase version numbers in `build.gradle`.
. Commit and push everything to Github.
. Create Pull Requests to master and dev branches.
. If those Pull Requests are accepted merge them back, but make sure, you are still based on the most recent versions of master and dev.
. Create a tag with the version on the merged master branch and push that tag to the repository.
. Make sure the new version is successfully publish by the https://github.com/cyface-de/android-backend/actions/new[Github Actions] to the https://github.com/cyface-de/android-backend/packages[Github Registry].
. Mark the released version as 'new Release' on https://github.com/cyface-de/data-collector/releases[Github].

In case you need to publish _manually_ to the Github Registry:

. Make sure you are authenticated to the repository:
 ** You need a Github account with write-access to this Github repository
 ** Create a https://github.com/settings/tokens[personal access token on Github] with "write:packages" permissions
 ** Create or adjust a `local.properties` file in the project root containing:

+
----
 github.user=YOUR_USERNAME
 github.token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
----
. Execute the publish command `./gradlew publishAll`
