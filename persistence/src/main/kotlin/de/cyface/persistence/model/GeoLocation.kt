/**
 * An `@Entity` which represents a persisted [ParcelableGeoLocation], usually captured by a GNSS.
 *
 * An instance of this class represents one row in a database table containing the location data.
 *
 * We hat to decouple [GeoLocation] from [ParcelableGeoLocation] as `accuracy` was `null` in the
 * superclass `init` block with Kotlin (after an upgrade) and Room w/ksp (just switched). This
 * should anyway be cleaner, as parcel is for capturing and the entity for the persistence layer.
 *
 * @author Armin Schnabel
 * @version 3.0.0
 * @since 6.3.0
 * @property id The system-wide unique identifier of this entity, generated by the data store.
 * It's `0`, which equals `null` in the non-nullable column `Long` when the entry is not yet persisted.
 * @property timestamp The time at this data point was captured in milliseconds since 1.1.1970.
 * @property lat The captured latitude of this data point in decimal coordinates as a value between
 * -90.0 (south pole) and 90.0 (north pole).
 * @property lon The captured longitude of this data point in decimal coordinates as a value between
 * -180.0 and 180.0.
 * @property altitude The captured altitude of this data point in meters above WGS 84.
 * @property speed The current speed of the measuring device according to its location sensor in meters per second.
 * @property accuracy The current accuracy of the measuring device in meters.
 * @property verticalAccuracy The current vertical accuracy of the measuring device in meters.
 * @property measurementId The device-unique id of the measurement this data point belongs to.
 * This foreign key points to [Measurement.id] and is indexed to avoid full table scan on parent update.
